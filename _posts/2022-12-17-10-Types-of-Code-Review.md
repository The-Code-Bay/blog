Welcome in, the **10th** article in our series about Code review. 

There are several types of code reviews that teams can use, each with its own set of benefits and considerations. Here are five types of code reviews:

## Peer Review

Peer review is the most common type of code review, where a developer's code is reviewed by one or more of their peers. This type of review is generally done before the code is merged into the main branch, and it is a good way to catch any bugs or issues before they become a problem. Peer reviews can be done in person or remotely, and they can be done using tools like code review software or by simply sharing code through a version control system like Git.

## Self Review

Self review is a type of code review where a developer reviews their own code before submitting it for review by their peers. This can be a good way for developers to catch their own mistakes and improve the overall quality of their code. However, it's important to note that self review should not be relied upon as the only form of code review, as it's easy for developers to overlook their own mistakes.

## Pair Programming

Pair programming is a type of code review where two developers work together to write and review code. One developer writes the code, while the other reviews it and suggests improvements. This type of review is a good way to catch bugs and improve code quality, as the two developers can collaborate to find and fix any issues. Pair programming can be done in person or remotely, and it's a good way for developers to learn from each other and improve their skills.

## Group Review

Group review is a type of code review where a group of developers review code together. This can be a good way to get multiple perspectives on a codebase and catch any issues that might have been missed by individual reviewers. Group reviews can be done in person or remotely, and they can be a good way for teams to collaborate and improve the overall quality of their code.

## Asynchronous Review

Asynchronous review is a type of code review where the review process is not done in real-time, but rather at the reviewer's convenience. This can be a good option for teams working in different time zones or for teams that have a high volume of code being reviewed. Asynchronous reviews can be done using code review software or by sharing code through a version control system like Git.

One of the main benefits of asynchronous review is that it allows reviewers to take their time and carefully consider the code being reviewed. This can lead to more thorough and detailed feedback, which can be beneficial for both the reviewer and the developer. However, it's important to establish clear communication channels and timelines for asynchronous reviews, as delays in feedback can impact the development process.

## Conclusion

Regardless of the type of code review being used, it's important for teams to establish clear guidelines and processes for conducting code reviews. This can help ensure that code reviews are efficient and effective, and that they are a positive experience for all involved.
