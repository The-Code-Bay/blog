Welcome in, the **8th** article in our series about Code review. In this article I would like to touch on the topic of mistakes of Code Reviewers.   

Reviewers play a crucial role in this process, as they are responsible for analyzing and commenting on code changes. However, reviewers are human and can make mistakes. Here are some common mistakes that reviewers of code review can make, and how to avoid them.

## Mistake #1: Not Understanding the Code or the Context

It is important for reviewers to have a good understanding of the code they are reviewing and the context in which it will be used. Without this understanding, it can be difficult to provide constructive feedback and identify potential issues. To avoid this mistake, reviewers should spend time familiarizing themselves with the code and the project before beginning the review process. It is also good to read the description of the user story.

## Mistake #2: Focusing on Minor Issues

It is important to pay attention to detail when reviewing code, but it is also important to keep the big picture in mind. Reviewers should focus on the most important issues and not get wrapped up in minor details. To avoid this mistake, reviewers should prioritize their comments and feedback based on the impact that the issue has on the code.

## Mistake #3: Being Overly Critical

Code review is an opportunity for reviewers to provide constructive feedback, not to criticize the code or the developer. Reviewers should aim to be helpful and constructive in their comments, rather than simply pointing out problems. To avoid being overly critical, reviewers should try to offer solutions or alternatives whenever possible.

## Mistake #4: Not Considering the Developer's Perspective

It is important for reviewers to consider the perspective of the developer who wrote the code. This can help to ensure that feedback is delivered in a way that is constructive and helpful, rather than confrontational. To avoid this mistake, reviewers should try to put themselves in the developer's shoes and consider how they might feel if they received similar feedback.

## Mistake #5: Not Following Coding Standards

Coding standards are important for maintaining code quality and consistency within a project. Reviewers should ensure that code changes adhere to these standards. To avoid this mistake, reviewers should familiarize themselves with the project's coding standards and make sure that they are being followed.

## Conclusion

By avoiding these common mistakes, reviewers can effectively contribute to the code review process and help to improve the quality of the code.
