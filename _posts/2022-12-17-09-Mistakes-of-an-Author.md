Welcome in, the **9th** article in our series about Code review. In the [previous post]({% post_url 2022-12-17-08-Mistakes-of-a-Reviewer %}) we described the mistakes of the reviewer. Here we will talk about what the author should watch out for.

As an author of a code review, it's important to take care to avoid common mistakes that can hinder the review process and cause frustration for both the reviewer and the team. Here are some common mistakes to watch out for:

## Mistake #1: Not providing enough context

It's important to provide sufficient context for the changes you've made and the reasoning behind them. This will help the reviewer understand the changes and provide more informed feedback.

## Mistake #2: Not following the team's code review guidelines

Each team may have its own guidelines for code reviews, such as specific formatting requirements or conventions to follow. It's important to follow these guidelines to ensure the review process goes smoothly.

## Mistake #3: Not being open to feedback

It's important to remember that code reviews are meant to improve the quality of the code and the overall project. As such, it's important to be open to constructive feedback and willing to make changes based on the reviewer's suggestions.

## Mistake #4: Not responding to comments

If the reviewer has made suggestions or raised questions, it's important to respond and address their concerns. Ignoring comments can make the reviewer feel like their time and effort was not valued.

## Mistake #5: Submitting incomplete or broken code

It's important to ensure that the code you submit for review is complete and functioning properly. Submitting broken or incomplete code will only delay the review process and make it more difficult for the reviewer to provide helpful feedback.

## Conclusion

By avoiding these mistakes, you can help ensure that code reviews are productive and valuable for the entire team. Remember, code reviews are a collaborative process and the goal is to improve the quality of the code and the project as a whole.
