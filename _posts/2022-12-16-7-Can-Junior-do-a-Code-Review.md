Welcome in, the next article in our series about Code review. In this article I would like to touch on the topic of whether a junior developer can do code review.

The short answer is **yes**, junior developers can absolutely do code reviews. In fact, it is often beneficial for junior developers to participate in code reviews as it gives them an opportunity to learn from more experienced team members and improve their own skills. It also helps to foster a sense of collaboration and teamwork within the team.

## Factors to consider when allowing junior developers to do code reviews

However, there are a few things to consider when it comes to junior developers doing code reviews. First and foremost, it is important to make sure that they have a good understanding of the programming language and frameworks being used, as well as any relevant coding standards and best practices. This will ensure that they are able to provide meaningful feedback and identify any potential issues with the code.   

In addition, it is good that the junior is not the only person doing code review. It is best to first let a junior review the code and add comments, and then an experienced person does a code review.

## Providing guidance and mentorship to junior developers during code review

Additionally, it may be helpful to provide junior developers with guidance or mentorship during the code review process. This could include pairing them with more experienced team members or providing them with resources or training to help them understand the code review process more fully.

In addition, after analyzing how junior did, it is worth to have a meeting and discus feedback. It is good to say what was well noted and what was missing and why.

## Conclusion

Overall, allowing junior developers to participate in code reviews can be a valuable learning opportunity for them, and can also help to improve the overall quality and efficiency of the team's code. It is important to provide the necessary support and guidance to ensure that junior developers are able to contribute effectively, but there is no reason why they should not be able to participate in code reviews.
